## 1. Write a program to check if the given pair of numbers are co-prime. 2 numbers are said to be co-prime if their gcd/hcm is 1

## 2. Write a program to check if the given number is a 'Disarium' number. A number is a 'Disarium' number if the sum of digits powered to their respective position is the number itself. For example - (135 -> 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135), (175 -> 1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175)

## 3. Write a program to generate all divisors of a number which is entered by the user.

## 4. Write a program to check if a number is a duck number or not. A number is said to be a duck number if it contains the digit 0.

## 5. Accept a number and check if the given number is even or odd.

## 6. Write a program to find the LCM of 2 numbers entered by the users.

## 7. Accept 3 numbers and print the square of the smallest number and the square root of the largest number.

## 8. Accept a number and check if the given number is even or odd. If the number is even, print the square of the number, else print the cube of the number.

## 9. Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number accepted from the user. Print the total sum.

## 10. Program a calculator to perform all the basic operations ('+' / '-' / '*' / '/' / '%') using switch case.

## 11. Accept two numbers x and y and calculate the yth power of x (i.e. x^y) using for loop.
