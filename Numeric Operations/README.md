# Numeric Operations

This folder contains programs that perform numeric operations on user input.

## Program list

`B` - Beginner, `I` - Intermediate, `A` - Advanced

* `B` [Write a program to check if the given pair of numbers are co-prime. 2 numbers are said to be co-prime if their gcd/hcm is 1](coPrimeNumbers.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to generate all divisors of a number which is entered by the user.](divisors.cpp)

* `B` [Accept a number and check if the given number is even or odd.](evenOdd.cpp)

* `B` [Accept 3 numbers and print the square of the smallest number and the square root of the largest number.](squareAndSquareRoot.cpp)

* `B` [Accept a number and check if the given number is even or odd. If the number is even, print the square of the number, else print the cube of the number.](squareOrCube.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number accepted from the user. Print the total sum.](sumOfDigitsOfNumber.cpp)

* `B` [Program a calculator to perform all the basic operations ('+' / '-' / '*' / '/' / '%') using switch case.](switchCalculator.cpp)

* `I` [Accept two numbers x and y and calculate the yth power of x (i.e. x^y) using for loop.](xRaisedToY.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to find the LCM of 2 numbers entered by the users.](lcm.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check if a number is a duck number or not. A number is said to be a duck number if it contains the digit 0.](duckNumber.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check if the given number is a 'Disarium' number. A number is a 'Disarium' number if the sum of digits powered to their respective position is the number itself. For example - (135 -> 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135), (175 -> 1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175)](disariumNumber.cpp)
