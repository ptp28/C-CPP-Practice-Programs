# Numeric Operations

This folder contains programs that perform numeric operations on user input.

## Program list

`B` - Beginner, `I` - Intermediate, `A` - Advanced

* `B` [Write a program to check if the given pair of numbers are co-prime. 2 numbers are said to be co-prime if their gcd/hcm is 1](coPrimeNumbers.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to generate all divisors of a number which is entered by the user.](divisors.cpp)

* `B` [Accept a number and check if the given number is even or odd.](evenOdd.cpp)

* `B` [Accept 3 numbers and print the square of the smallest number and the square root of the largest number.](squareAndSquareRoot.cpp)

* `B` [Accept a number and check if the given number is even or odd. If the number is even, print the square of the number, else print the cube of the number.](squareOrCube.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a number accepted from the user. Print the total sum.](sumOfDigitsOfNumber.cpp)

* `B` [Program a calculator to perform all the basic operations ('+' / '-' / '*' / '/' / '%') using switch case.](switchCalculator.cpp)

* `I` [Accept two numbers x and y and calculate the yth power of x (i.e. x^y) using for loop.](xRaisedToY.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to find the LCM of 2 numbers entered by the users.](lcm.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check if a number is a duck number or not. A number is said to be a duck number if it contains the digit 0.](duckNumber.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check if the given number is a 'Disarium' number. A number is a 'Disarium' number if the sum of digits powered to their respective position is the number itself. For example - (135 -> 1^1 + 3^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 9 + 125 = 135), (175 -> 1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175)](disariumNumber.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check whether a number is an armstrong number or not. A number is said to be an armstrong number of order n (order is number of digits) if - 
</br>&emsp;153 => (1*1*1) + (5*5*5) + (3*3*3) = 1+125+27 = 153](armstrongNumber.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to accept a decimal number and convert it into binary form. For example - 
</br>&emsp;I/P: 111
</br>&emsp;O/P: 7](binaryToDecimal.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to accept a decimal number and convert it into binary form. For example - 
</br>&emsp;I/P: 7
</br>&emsp;O/P: 111](decimalToBinary.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to accept a decimal number and convert it into hexadecimal form. For example - 
</br>&emsp;I/P: 10
</br>&emsp;O/P: A](decimalToHexadecimal.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to accept a decimal number and convert it into hexadecimal form. For example - 
</br>&emsp;I/P: A
</br>&emsp;O/P: 10](hexadecimalToDecimal.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to calculate the hamming distance between two numbers. Hamming distance can be found by converting the numbers into their binary equivalents and count the number of different digits.](hammingDistance.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check whether a number is a krishnamurty/special number or not. A number is said to be a krishnamurty number if the sum of the factorial of its digits is the number itself. For example - 
</br>&emsp;145 => 1!+4!+5! = 1+24+120 = 145](krishnamurtyNumber.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check if the given number is a magic number. A number is a magic number if the successive sum of its digits is 1. For example - 
</br>&emsp;82 -> 8+2 = 10, 10 -> 1+0 = 1](magicNumber.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to check if the given number is a magic number. A number is a magic number if the successive sum of its digits is 1. For example - 
</br>&emsp;82 -> 8+2 = 10, 10 -> 1+0 = 1](magicNumber.cpp)
