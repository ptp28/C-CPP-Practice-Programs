## Program list

`B` - Beginner, `I` - Intermediate, `A` - Advanced

* `B` [Write a program to accept a list of numbers and seperate it to create a list of all entered postive numbers and a list of all entered negative numbers.](seperatePostiveNegative.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to accept a list of numbers and print the sum of all even numbers and the sum of all odd numbers seperately.](sumOfEvenAndOdd.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to find that the largest number amongst a collection of numbers which are stored in an array](maxElementArray.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to find that the smallest number amongst a collection of numbers which are stored in an array](minElementArray.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to accept an array and find its range. The range of an array is defined as the difference between the maximum value element of the array and the minimum value element of the array.](arrayRange.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to perform a linear search on an array on N numbers where the array as well as the key to search is accepted from the user](linearSearch.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to perform a binary search on an array on N numbers where the array as well as the key to search is accepted from the user](binarySearch.cpp)

* `B` [Accept an array and print the largest and the second largest number of the entered array](arraySecondLargest.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to accept a 3x3 matrix, display the matrix and print the lower triangle of the matrix.](lowerTriangularMatrix.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to accept a 3x3 matrix, display the matrix and check if the matrix is symmetric or not.](symmtericMatrix.cpp)

* `I` [Write a program to find the saddle point of the matrix. A saddle point is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum element in its column.](matrixSaddlePoint.cpp)

* `I` [An array is called a 'lucky' array if the frequency of the minimum elements is odd, otherwise it is considered 'unlucky'. Check  if the array is lucky or not. Accept the array having N integers from the users.](luckyArray.cpp)

* `I` [Input integer array and add the elements having same value, thus reducing the number of elements in the array. 
</br>&emsp;I/P: 1 4 2 9 2 4 6 9
</br>&emsp;O/P: 1 8 4 18 6](arrayReduce.cpp)

* `A` [The distance between two array values is the number of indices between them. Given a, find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, return -1. For example - 
<br>&emsp;a = \[3,2,1,2,3\]
<br>&emsp;There are two matching pairs of values: 3 and 2. The indices of the 3's are i=0 and j=4, so their distance is d\[i,j\]=|j-i| = 4
<br>&emsp;The indices of the 2's are i=1 and j=3, so their distance is d\[i,j\]=|j-i| = 2.
<br>&emsp;The minimum distance is min(4,2) = 2.](minimumDistance.cpp)

* `A` [Implement array as a queue. Create a menu driven program which includes functions to push, pop, empty queue, display queue and check if the queue is empty/full.](arrayAsQueue.cpp)

* `A` [Implement array as a stack. Create a menu driven program which includes functions to push, pop, empty stack, display stack and check if the stack is empty/full.](arrayAsStack.cpp)

* `A` [Write a program to accept three digits(0-9) and display the combinations of it i.e. for digits 1,2,3 , the combinations are 123,132,213,231,312,321.](combinationsOf3DigitNumber.cpp)

* `A` [It is New Year's Day and people are in line for the Wonderland rollercoaster ride. Each person wears a sticker indicating their initial position in the queue from 1 to n. Any person can bribe the person directly in front of them to swap positions, but they still wear their original sticker. One person can bribe at most two others.
Determine the minimum number of bribes that took place to get to a given queue order. Print the number of bribes, or, if anyone has bribed more than two people, print Too chaotic.](bribeCalculator.cpp)
