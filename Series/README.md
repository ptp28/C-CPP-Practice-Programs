`B` - Beginner, `I` - Intermediate, `A` - Advanced

* `B` [Display the fibonacci series up to n values where 'n' is accepted from the user](fibonacciSeries.cpp)
* `B` [Write a program to print the following series (Let user decide using switch case)
</br>&emsp;a)  1   4   7   10  ......   40
</br>&emsp;b)  1  -4   7  -10  ......  -40](incrementBy3Series.cpp)

* `B` [Write a program to print 
<br>&emsp;1   2   4   8   16  ..... n
<br>&emsp;Accept n from the user. Also display the sum of the series](powerOf2Series.cpp)

* `I` [A space explorer's ship crashed on Mars! They send a series of 'SOS' messages to Earth for help. 
<br>&emsp;Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. 
<br>&emsp;Given the signal received by Earth as a string, s, determine how many letters of the SOS message have been changed by radiation. For example - 
<br>&emsp;I/P: SOSTOT
<br>&emsp;O/P: 2](messageTransmissionError.cpp)
